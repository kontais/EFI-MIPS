<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <B>_LIBC_Start_U, _LIBC_Start_Shellapp_U</B> - EFI entry point for applications.

</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;atk_libc.h&gt;</B>

     <I>EFI_STATUS</I>
     <B>_LIBC_Start_U</B>(<I>EFI_HANDLE</I> <I>ImgHandle</I>, <I>EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE</I> <I>*SysTable</I>)

     <I>EFI_STATUS</I>
     <B>_LIBC_Start_Shellapp_U</B>(<I>EFI_HANDLE</I> <I>ImgHandle</I>, <I>EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE</I> <I>*SysTable</I>)

</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     These functions are provided as EFI entry points and should not be called within an EFI
     application.  Instead, functions that define these as the EFI entry point will supply an
     entry point with the prototype

     <I>int main(int argc, wchar_t **argv);</I>

     that will be called from these functions. 

     <B>_LIBC_Start_U</B>() is the entry point for EFI LIBC applications that do not require the EFI
     Shell environment.  This is the preferred entry point for LIBC based applications written
     with EFI Application ToolKit Version 0.80 or later.
     
     <B>_LIBC_Start_Shellapp_U</B>() is the entry point for EFI LIBC applications that depend on the
     EFI Shell environment such as those written with EFI Application Toolkit Version 0.72 or
     earlier.  This interface is being kept for backward compatibility only.  LIBC
     applications developed with Toolkit Version 0.80 or later are encouraged to use
     <B>_LIBC_Start_U</B>().  Programs using the <B>_LIBC_Start_Shellapp_U</B> entry point must also link
     to <I>libefhshell.lib</I> as well as <I>libefi.lib</I>.

     Both entry points initializes LIBC.  <B>_LIBC_Start_Shellapp_U</B>() will also initialize the
     EFI Shell Interface Library and the EFI Library.  Next, they extract command line and
     current working directory from the runtime environment and then call a user supplied
     <B>main()</B> passing Unicode command line arguments.  On return from <B>main</B>(), <B>exit</B>() is called
     to insure that LIBC is terminated properly.

     Both entry points intialize global variables <B>_LIBC_EFIImageHandle</B> and
     <B>_LIBC_EFISystemTable</B> which provide access to the application's image handle and EFI
     system table respectively.
