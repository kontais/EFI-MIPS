</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>mktime</B> utility is a Win32 application.  <B>mktime</B> converts a time source
     definition into a format usable by the locale-dependent functions. It is
     used to define the many ways in which locale-dependent functions output.

     It reads <I>Inputfile</I> which is a LC_TIME source file and produces a
     <I>OutputFile</I> which is a LC_TIME binary file suitable for placement in
     /etc/locale/<I>language</I>/LC_TIME.

     Options list: </PRE>
<PRE>	<I>-d</I>: used for debugging.  </PRE>
<PRE>	<I>Outputfile: its default value is </I>LC_TIME

</PRE>
<PRE>     The time source definition file is formated as belows:

     The 1 - 12 valid lines are national representation of abbreviated month
     names.

     The 13 - 24 valid lines are national representation of full month names.

     The 25 - 31 valid lines are national representation of abbreviated week-
     day names.

     The 32 - 38 valid lines are national representation of full weekday
     names.

     The 39 valid line is X_fmt string.

     The 40 valid line is x_fmt string.

     The 41 valid line is c_fmt string.

     The 42 valid line is abbreviation morning string.

     The 43 valid line is abbreviation afternoon string.

     The 44 valid line is date_fmt string.

</PRE>
<PRE>     X_fmt string is used for national representation of the time.

     x_fmt string is used for national representation of the date.

     c_fmt string is used for national representation of time and date (the
     format is similar with produced by <B>asctime(3)</B>.

          %Y    is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.

          %y    is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number
    (00-99).

          %z    is replaced by the time zone offset from UTC; a leading plus
     sign stands for east of UTC, a minus sign for west of UTC, hours
