<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>wcsftime</B>() function formats the information from <I>timeptr</I> into the
     buffer <I>buf</I> according to the string pointed to by <I>format</I>.

     The <I>format</I> string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and
     ordinary characters.  All ordinary characters are copied directly into
     the buffer.  A conversion specification consists of a percent sign
     ```%''' and one other character.

     No more than <I>maxsize</I> characters will be placed into the array.  If the
     total number of resulting characters, including the terminating NUL char-
     acter, is not more than <I>maxsize</I>, <B>wcsftime</B>() returns the number of charac-
     ters in the array, not counting the terminating NUL.  Otherwise, zero is
     returned and the buffer contents is indeterminate.

     The conversion specifications are copied to the buffer after expansion as
     follows:-

     <B>%A</B>    is replaced by national representation of the full weekday name.

     <B>%a</B>    is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated weekday
           name, where the abbreviation is the first three characters.

     <B>%B</B>    is replaced by national representation of the full month name.

     <B>%b</B>    is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated month
           name, where the abbreviation is the first three characters.

     <B>%C</B>    is replaced by (year / 100) as decimal number; single digits are
           preceded by a zero.

     <B>%c</B>    is replaced by national representation of time and date (the format
           is similar with produced by <B>asctime(3)</B>).

     <B>%D</B>    is equivalent to ``%m/%d/%y''.

     <B>%d</B>    is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31).

     <B>%G</B>    is replaced by a year as a decimal number with century.  This year
           is the one that contains the greater part of the week (Monday as
           the first day of the week).

     <B>%g</B>    is replaced by the same year as in ``%G'', but as a decimal number

           without century (00-99).

     <B>%H</B>    is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number
           (00-23).

     <B>%h</B>    the same as %b.

     <B>%I</B>    is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number
           (01-12).

     <B>%j</B>    is replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366).

     <B>%k</B>    is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0-23);
           single digits are preceded by a blank.

     <B>%l</B>    is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1-12);
           single digits are preceded by a blank.

     <B>%M</B>    is replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59).

     <B>%m</B>    is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12).

     <B>%n</B>    is replaced by a newline.

     <B>%O*</B>   the same as %E*.

     <B>%p</B>    is replaced by national representation of either "ante meridiem" or
           "post meridiem" as appropriate.

     <B>%R</B>    is equivalent to ``%H:%M''.

     <B>%r</B>    is equivalent to ``%I:%M:%S %p''.

     <B>%S</B>    is replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-60).

     <B>%s</B>    is replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC (see
           <B>mktime(3)</B>).

     <B>%T</B>    is equivalent to ``%H:%M:%S''.

     <B>%t</B>    is replaced by a tab.

     <B>%U</B>    is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day
           of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

     <B>%u</B>    is replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the week) as

     <B>%v</B>    is equivalent to ``%e-%b-%Y''.

     <B>%W</B>    is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day
           of the week) as a decimal number (00-53).

     <B>%w</B>    is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week) as
           a decimal number (0-6).

     <B>%X</B>    is replaced by national representation of the time.



     <B>%x</B>    is replaced by national representation of the date.

     <B>%Y</B>    is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.

     <B>%y</B>    is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number
           (00-99).

     <B>%Z</B>    is replaced by the time zone name.

     <B>%+</B>    is replaced by national representation of the date and time (the
           format is similar to that produced by <B>date(1)</B>).

     <B>%%</B>    is replaced by `%'.

<H2>STANDARDS</H2><PRE>
     The <B>wcsftime</B>() function conforms to ISO 9899: 1990 (``ISO C'') with a lot
     of extensions including `%C', `%D', `%E*', `%e', `%G', `%g', `%h', `%k',
     `%l', `%n', `%O*', `%R', `%r', `%s', `%T', `%t', `%u', `%V', `%+'.

     The peculiar week number and year in the replacements of `%G', `%g' and
     `%V' are defined in ISO 8601: 1988.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     There is no conversion specification for the phase of the moon.
