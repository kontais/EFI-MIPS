	* elilo 3.12 release commit
	* Added additional #defines for debug levels to reduce the output
	* Added Mac console patch rework from Julien Blache @ debian
	  this fixes the invisible console output from elilo on Macs
	* Moved static ELILO_VERSION variable from elilo.c to elilo.h
	  so that elilo will print its version string and arch on startup.
	* Fixed bug 2825044 ExitBootServices error handling, correctly deal
	  with changed memory map key if memory map changes from under elilo.
	* Added memory map key to map debug output.
	* Fixed bug 2874380 netbooting just flat broken. fixed ia64, x86_64
	  ia32, fixed handling of server side support of tfpt options (get file size) 
	  elilo now attempts to get file size before attempting read of file
	  to set the buffers up correctly and deal with tftp servers that dont
	  support options extensions a little better.
	* netboot, fixed bad blocksize handling
	* netboot, fixed filename length for elilo-x86_64.conf type on tftp
	  server.
	* increased bzimage kernel max length sizes to 4mb on i386 and 8mb on
	  x86_64... this is a legacy design hold over from original design and
	  needs to be re-written to do dynamic size memory management based on
	  the size of the actual vmlinuz image, as ia64/gzip does.

	* elilo 3.10 release commit
	* Bumped version string to 3.10
	* added PTR_FMT 32bit & 64bit pointer translation for correct output
	* elilo hang bugfix x86_64 non-standard kernels with non-traditional start address 
	  elilo will pull the start address from the kernel elf header for 2.6
	  or newer kernels, map memory and use that start address, else use standard
	  1MB default start address. And handle case of overlapping kernels
	  and initrds in memory. Patch contributor Stuart Hayes @ Dell,
	  thanks Stuart!
	* ported kernel start adress fix to ia32
	* eliminated all possible compiler warnings except those actually
	  caused by gnu-efi that cant be fixed here.
	* Debug output improvement, added pauses with visual feedback when
	  user sets debug & verbose options.
	* bugfix added missing find_bits function definition back into ia32
	  subtree
	* bugfix loader_probe now correctly errors out if no loaders
	  registered.

	* Various compile warning cleanups.

2008-01-03 signed off by Jason Fleischli <jason.fleischli@hp.com>
	* Patch contribution from Scott Davilla <davilla@4pi.com>
	  when x is zero for the first call to add_memory_region, e820_map[-1] 
	  will access memory outside the bounds of e820_map. While this does 
	  not result in any problems as there is a UINT32 unused_8[41] block 
	  above the e820_map[0] location that should have been zeroed by the 
	  bootloader, the code should not access outside the bounds of 
	  structures. 

2008-01-03 Jason Fleischli <jason.fleischli@hp.com>
	* initrd.c -- Let the allocator decide where to grab the memory from 
	  the efi memory map. Current start_addr=image->start_addr forces the 
	  same efi region everytime, and has a 7mb limit. ramdisk (initrd.img) 
	  files larger than 7MB wouldnt fit into the memory region assumed by 
	  the image->start_addr resulting in an elilo hang. Leaving start_addr 
	  NULL at initialization forces alloc_pages to get a memory region 
	  sufficient for the size of the initrd image.

2007-12-19 Jason Fleischli <jason.fleischli@hp.com>
	* bumping version string to 3.8

2007-12-19 Jason Fleischli <jason.fleischli@hp.com>
	* MORE PATCHES FROM INTEL FOR IA32 X86_64.
	* Fix compile warning for cmdline_addr assignment.
	* Fix an issue caused by uninitialized e820_nr_map in fill_e820map.
	* On some machines, there are too many EFI memory map entries, so that,
	  the number of E820 map entries converted from EFI memory map exceeds
	  the limit (128). This patch fixes this bug by merging consecutive
	  memory map entries with the same type.
	* CL_MAGIC is not supported by 32-bit boot protocol. So, the kernel
	  command line passing code is changed accordingly.
	* EFI-2.0 boot support patches have been accepted into Linux kernel
	  2.6.24-rc4 and EFI runtime service patches have been accepted by
	  Linux kernel 2.6.24-rc4-mm1. There are some changes during the 
	  merging, so there are some updates for elilo ia32/x86_64 too.
	* The x86_64 boot parameters of Linux kernel is rearranged to line up
	  with ia32 boot parameters.
	* The boot loader signature of IA32 and x86_64 is redefined to
	  make it possible for Linux kernel to distinguish whether the 
	  underlying firmware is EFI 32 or EFI 64.
	* The EFI framebuffer type ID is changed in Linux kernel to
	  conform to Linux kernel framebuffer type ID grouping rules. So the 
	  EFI framebuffer type ID setting code in ELILO is changed accordingly.
	* E820 memory map is added to IA32 to make it possible for
	  Linux kernel not to depend on EFI memory map on EFI 32.

2007-09-27 Jason Fleischli <jason.fleischli@hp.com>
	* updating changelog for last commit that was omitted
	* incorporating AGriffis patches to enhance parsing
	  passes root= option to kernel options and accounts for -- option

2006-01-27 Alex Williamson <alex.williamson@hp.com>
	* Found a couple more places where vmcode isn't zeroed, causing the
	  option to get carried over to labels it shouldn't.

2006-01-09 Brett Johnson <brett@hp.com>
	* Released 3.6

2005-12-22 Alex Williamson <alex.williamson@hp.com>
	* Fixed vmcode_name initialization in textmenu chooser

2005-12-01 Alex Williamson <alex.williamson@hp.com>
	* Applied patch from Fred Yang <fred.yang@intel.com> to support the
	  vmm= boot option.  This option specifies the kernel image for a
	  virtual machine monitor (aka hypervisor).  The vmm= and image=
	  options are used together to load both the hypervisor kernel and
	  the guest domain kernel into memory.  If a vmm= option is not
	  specified, elilo defaults to the old behavior of loading and booting
	  to the image= kernel.
	* Added support for compressed image= files when used with the vmm=
	  option.  If the image= file is detected to be gzip compressed, the
	  image will be uncompressed into memory before it is provided to the
	  hypervisor.  Any combination of compressed and uncompressed images
	  can be used for the image and vmm options.

2005-09-15 Brett Johnson <brett@hp.com>
	* Applied patch from Tristan Gingold to add dcache flush and sync with
	  icache to gzip and plain loaders.  This ommision was just noticed now
	  due to the much larger caches in Montecito, and the smaller size of
	  Xen (as compared to the linux kernel).

2004-09-27 Brett Johnson <brett@hp.com>
	* Increase the hardcoded size of the texmenu chooser menu from 16 to 64

2004-09-23 Brett Johnson <brett@hp.com>
	* Fix for 924147.  Thanks to Stephanie Schaaf <sas@sgi.com> for a patch

	  open via netfs. Suggestion and initial patch by Guy Laborde from HP.

2003-01-28 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fix the set_default_path() routine in glue_localfs.c. It would not

	  elilo.conf not to be found sometimes.

2003-01-21 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fix bug in glue_netfs.c convert_ip2decstr() which caused some IP

        * added support for 2 possible config file (now just on netboot). The first
          (primary) choice uses a host specific filename based on the IP address. Suggestion
	  from Egan Ford <egan@sense.net>.

2001-04-06  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* incorporated patches from David and Michael Johnston at Intel

	  Makefile and start_kernel() function.

2001-04-06  Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

	* Fixed config.c  to
	  get the timeout directive to do something. implemented the global

	  taking the config file feature of ELI.

	* renamed LILO to ELILO to make the distinction

	* restructured code to make it easier to understand and maintain

	* fixed FPSWA driver checking and loading: we try all possible
	  files and let the driver itself figure out if it is the most
	  recent.
	* added support for compression (gzip) but keep support for plain
	  ELF image. ELILO autodetects the format

	* change the way the kernel is invoked. Now we call it in 
	  physical memory mode. This breaks the dependency between the
	  kernel code and the loader. No more lilo_start.c madness.

	* changed the way the boot_params are passed. We don't use the 
	  ZERO_PAGE_ADDR trick anymore. Instead we use EFI runtime memory.
	  The address of the structure is passed to the kernel in r28
	  by our convention.

	* released as gnu-efi-2.0

2001-04-03  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c (_relocate): Change return type from "void"
	to "int".  Return error status if relocation fails for some
	reason.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia32_efi.lds: Drop unneeded ".rel.reloc" section.

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (_start): Exit if _relocate() returns with
	non-zero exit status.

	* inc/ia32/efibind.h [__GNUC__]: Force 8-byte alignment for 64-bit
	types as that is what EFI appears to be expecting, despite the
	"#pragma pack()" at the beginning of the file!

2001-03-29  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c: Add a couple of defines to work around
	libc/efilib collision on uint64_t et al.
	(_relocate): Use ELF32_R_TYPE() instead of ELFW(R_TYPE)().

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (dummy): Add a dummy relocation entry.

        * gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c: Add a couple of defines to work around
        libc/efilib collision on uint64_t et al.
        (_relocate): Use ELF32_R_TYPE() instead of ELFW(R_TYPE)().

        * gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (dummy): Add a dummy relocation entry.

2000-10-26  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>
 
 	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Mention .rela.sdata.
 
 	* Make.defaults (CFLAGS): Remove -nostdinc flags so we can pick
 	up the C compiler's stdarg.h.
 
 	* inc/stdarg.h: Remove this file.  It's not correct for gcc (nor
 	most other optimizing compilers).

2000-10-10  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* cleaned up the error message and printing of those.
	* added support to load the FPSWA from a file in case support is not
	  present in the firmware already
	* fixed split_args() to do the right thing when you have leading spaces
	  before kernel name
	* changed the argify() function to rely on \0 instead of LoadOptionSize
	  as the field seems to be broken with current firmware
	* bumped version to 1.0

2000-10-04  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>
 
	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S: Reserve space for up to 750 function descriptors.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Add .sdata section for small data and
	put __gp in the "middle" of it.

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia64.S (_start): Use movl/add to load
	gp-relative addresses that could be out of the range of the addl
	offset.
	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S (_relocate): Ditto.

	* apps/Makefile: Remove standard rules and include Make.rules instead.
	* lilo/Makefile: Ditto.

	* Make.rules: New file.

2000-08-04  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* released version 0.9
	* incorporated ACPI changes for Asuza by NEC < kouchi@hpc.bs1.fc.nec.co.jp>
	* added support for initrd (-i option) original ELI code from Bill Nottingham <notting@redhat.com>)
	* lots of cleanups 
	* got rid of #ifdef LILO_DEBUG and uses macro instead
	* fix a few extra memory leaks in create_boot_params()
	* added exit capability just before starting the kernel

2000-06-22  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Add .srodata, .ctors, .IA64.unwind,
	.IA64.unwind_info to .data section and .rela.ctors to .rela
	section.

2000-04-03  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* lilo/lilo.c (LILO_VERSION): Up version number to 0.9.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Include .IA_64.unwind and
	.IA_64.unwind_info in .data segment to avoid EFI load error
	"ImageAddress: pointer outside of image" error due to the .dynsym
	relocations against these sections.

	* ChangeLog: Moved from lilo/ChangeLogs.

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S: fixed typo: .space directive had constant
	100 hardcoded instead of using MAX_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTORS
	macro. Duh.

Fri Mar 17 15:19:18 PST 2000 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* Released 0.8
	* replace the  getopt.c with new version free with better license
	* created a documentation file
	* fix a couple of memory leaks
	* code cleanups
	* created a separate directory for lilo in the gnu-efi package.
	* added support for the BOOT_IMAGE argument to kernel
	* default is to build natively now
