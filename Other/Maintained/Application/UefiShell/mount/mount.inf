#  Module Name:
#
#    mount.inf
#
#  Abstract:
#
#    Component description file for building an application for the shell
#    command mount.
#
#  Notes:
#    BASE_NAME   - names the output file (mount.efi here)
#    FILE_GUID   - required by the build tool, but not used anywhere for this
#    BUILD_TYPE  - tells the build process to use the 
#                  [build.$(PROCESSOR).$(BUILD_TYPE)] section of the DSC file
#                  to build it. Make sure the DSC file has this section.
#    FV          - define as NULL to indicate to the build tools that the
#                  final build target does not go into any firmware volume.
#
#  Use of this file requires building in and linking the Shell library.
#  You must also add it to the DSC file somewhere after the shell has been 
#  built.
